# odin-inventory-application
odin22. This is an inventory management application for an imaginary soccer store.

Use a .env file to store database credentials. They are used in db/pool.js.

When accessing the psql database from the terminal, I used the following commands:

    \c top_inventory_app - to get into the database.
    \dt - to list all tables
    \d __table__ - to show the table definition
    \q - to quit
